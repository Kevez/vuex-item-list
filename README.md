# Vuex socket.io item list

## Install dependencies
```
npm install
```

### Start socket server
```
node server
```

### Start app (open new terminal tab)
```
npm run serve

Now go to localhost:8080 in your browser to see the app running. To see websockets in action open another browser/window and run them side by side. Each time a change is made it should update in real-time.
